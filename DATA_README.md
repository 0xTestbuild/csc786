## Project Dataset Overview
The Red Team Lab project does not use external datasets. All data generated or used is simulated within the lab environment for educational purposes.

## Generated Data
- **Logs:** All logs generated during testing (e.g., exploit attempts, network scans) are stored locally in the lab environment.
- **Output Files:** Results of scripts, simulations, or testing exercises are saved in the repository under structured folders.

## Parameters and Configuration
- Virtual machines were configured with controlled IP addresses and services for testing purposes.
- Script parameters (e.g., scanning ranges, simulated targets) are fully documented within the notebook and code comments.

## Ethics and Handling
- No real network data, credentials, or personal information were collected.
- All generated data is for educational/research purposes only.
- Users replicating the workflow should maintain isolation and avoid using real-world targets.
